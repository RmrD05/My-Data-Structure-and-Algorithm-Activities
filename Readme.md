The System that I made is a data handling system that accepts inputs and sorting it.
It utilizes Binary Search Trees and is capable of storing family surnames and the number of individuals in that family. 
Itâ€™s very important because right after encoding the data, it is quickly sorted. 
The reason behind the idea is that I had always witnessed people giving surveys or censuses to households. 
That sparked an idea in me to create a system that will lessen the efforts needed to efficiently gather data.

The systems feature includes:
1. Inserting
2. Displaying the data inputted
3. Deleting
4. Searching for data
