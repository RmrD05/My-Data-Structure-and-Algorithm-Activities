#**Census Application**

## Introduction
The System that I made is a data handling system that accepts inputs and sorting it.
It utilizes Binary Search Trees and is capable of storing family surnames and the number of individuals in that family. 
It’s very important because right after encoding the data, it is quickly sorted.

#**Job Scheduling Application**

## Introduction
The system is a data management program, wherein the user inputs the number of jobs, its description, and lastly it gives the user the ability to assign which job should be prioritized using the largest possible integer input from the user as bases. This system utilizes a Max Heap structure wherein the largest is always at the top, out of all the inputted data.

2. **Process Job**: Process job and sort with priority
3. **Delete Job**:  Deleting job upon completion

## Purpose and Impact
### Why was this application created?
-**The reason behind this is application is that its  always better to put priority labels on the tasks or jobs we want to do first.**

### How does it help the community?
The **Job Scheduling Application** benefits both learners and the community by:
- **Educational Value**: Helping students and beginners understand graph theory and its applications in an interactive way.
- **Encouraging Connectivity**: Simulating how technology can enhance connections and suggest relationships, fostering ideas for real-world applications.
- **Priorities**: Helping students and minds alike to learn the way of doing things that are really important

This application aids students and people with doing tasks and prioritizing activities to a more efficient and time sufficient method.

#**Demographic Application**

## Introduction
My “Demographic management system” is a data system that accepts inputs and sorts them alphabetically by name. I made this system in accordance with the census I made using a binary search tree, and I plan to further enhance this. This system sorts its data right after the user inputs it. This system utilizes a hashing function and a hash table to store the inputted data.

## Features
The application includes the following functionalities:
The systems feature includes:
1. **Insert Family and Monthly Salary**: Input family data to the system
2. **Traversal and Display Family along with Monthly Salary**: Display family name and their monthly salary
3. **Delete Family**:  Delete family name and data
4. **Search  Family**: Traverse and search for family

## Purpose and Impact
### Why was this application created?
-**The idea behind this system is to swiftly access and traverse data using hash tables.**
-**With the use of hashtables, inserting and traversing the database is much faster thus it is helpful in data storing.**
-**This is beneficial in the community in terms of demographic data gathering and making accessing of data more easily achieved.**

### How does it help the community?
The **Demographic Application** benefits both learners and the community by:
- **Educational Value**: Helping students and beginners understand hashing and its applications in an interactive way.
- **Encouraging Connectivity**: Simulating how technology can enhance connections, data gathering, and fostering ideas for real-world applications.
- **Data handling**: This application aids in handling data efficiently making data gathering swift.

This application aids the swift gathering and accessing of these data that are crucial for demographic gathering in large or small scale population.

  
#**Destination Application**

## Introduction
It is a system that accepts inputs from the user, it is capable of adding cities and the distance between them, after adding the required data, it can then be displayed. This application utilizes weighted-graph data structures and its function includes distance measuring from point A to point B.

 The reason in the creation of this system is inspired from google map wherein this will still need the data to be inputted from the user. This system utilizes a graph data structure where each city added is put on a node and the distance is the weight of the edge per vertice.

The System features include the following:

1. Inserting vertices or the cities
2. Adding the weight of the edges or the distance
3. Displaying the stored data
