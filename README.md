#Census Application

## Introduction
The System that I made is a data handling system that accepts inputs and sorting it.
It utilizes Binary Search Trees and is capable of storing family surnames and the number of individuals in that family. 
It’s very important because right after encoding the data, it is quickly sorted.

## Features
The application includes the following functionalities:
The systems feature includes:
1. **Insert Family**: Input family data to the system
2. **Display Family**: Display family name and data
3. **Delete Family**:  Delete family name and data
4. **Search  Family**: Traverse and search for family

## Purpose and Impact
### Why was this application created?
-**The reason behind the idea is that I had always witnessed people giving surveys or censuses to households.**
-**That sparked an idea in me to create a system that will lessen the efforts needed to efficiently gather data.**

### How does it help the community?
The **Census Application** benefits both learners and the community by:
- **Educational Value**: Helping students and beginners understand graph theory and its applications in an interactive way.
- **Encouraging Connectivity**: Simulating how technology can enhance connections and suggest relationships, fostering ideas for real-world applications.

This application aids the swift gathering and accessing of these data that are crucial for data gathering.

**Job Scheduling System**
The system is a data management program, wherein the user inputs the number of jobs, its description, and lastly it gives the user the ability to assign which job should be prioritized using the largest possible integer input from the user as bases. This system utilizes a Max Heap structure wherein the largest is always at the top, out of all the inputted data.
The reason behind this is that its  always better if we put labels on which things we want to focus on.

The System feature includes 

1.Inserting
2.Displaying of the data
3.Deleting data

My “Demographic management system” is a data system that accepts inputs and sorts them alphabetically by name. I made this system in accordance with the census I made using a binary search tree, and I plan to further enhance this. This system sorts its data right after the user inputs it. This system utilizes a hashing function and a hash table to store the inputted data. The idea behind this system is to swiftly access and traverse data using hash tables. This is beneficial in the community in terms of demographic data gathering and making accessing of data more easily achieved.

 The system features include the following:
 
 1. Insertion of data
 2. Deletion of data
 3. Searching of data
 4. Sorting of inputted data
 5. Traversal and displaying of data
  
Destination Application
It is a system that accepts inputs from the user, it is capable of adding cities and the distance between them, after adding the required data, it can then be displayed. The reason in the creation of this system is inspired from google map wherein this will still need the data to be inputted from the user. This system utilizes a graph data structure where each city added is put on a node and the distance is the weight of the edge per vertice.

The System features include the following:

1. Inserting vertices or the cities
2. Adding the weight of the edges or the distance
3. Displaying the stored data
