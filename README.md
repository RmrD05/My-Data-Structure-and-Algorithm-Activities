Census System
The System that I made is a data handling system that accepts inputs and sorting it.
It utilizes Binary Search Trees and is capable of storing family surnames and the number of individuals in that family. 
Itâ€™s very important because right after encoding the data, it is quickly sorted. 
The reason behind the idea is that I had always witnessed people giving surveys or censuses to households. 
That sparked an idea in me to create a system that will lessen the efforts needed to efficiently gather data.

The systems feature includes:
1. Inserting
2. Displaying the data inputted
3. Deleting
4. Searching for data

Job Scheduling System
The system is a data management program, wherein the user inputs the number of jobs, its description, and lastly it gives the user the ability to assign which job should be prioritized using the largest possible integer input from the user as bases. This system utilizes a Max Heap structure wherein the largest is always at the top, out of all the inputted data.
The reason behind this is that its  always better if we put labels on which things we want to focus on.

The System feature includes 
1.Inserting
2.Displaying of the data
